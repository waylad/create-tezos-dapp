Welcome to the Create Tezos Dapp documentation!

## Navigation

You can find different topics in the table of contents. On desktop, you should see it in the left sidebar. On mobile, you should see it after pressing an icon with arrows in the top left corner.

## Looking for React Docs?

The documentation for React itself is located on a separate website: **[reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/)**.

This website is only about Create Tezos Dapp.
